        <h2>What are the rules of RPS?</h2>
        <br>
        <p>Although the game has a lot of complexity to it, the rules to play it are pretty simple.
            The game is played where players deliver hand signals that will represent the elements of the game; rock, paper and scissors. The outcome of the game is determined by 3 simple rules:
            <ul>
                <li>Rock wins against scissors.</li>
                <li>Scissors win against paper.</li>
                <li>Paper wins against rock.</li>            
            </ul>
